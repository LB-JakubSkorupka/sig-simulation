# Deforming Objects Workflow Tests

Testing in this area should focus on the Deforming Objects.

## General Docs

* [O3DE Animation Editor Concepts and Terms](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/visualization/animation/character-editor/concepts-and-terms/)
* [O3DE Animation Editor User Interface](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/visualization/animation/animation-editor/user-interface/)
* [O3DE Getting Started With Animation Editor](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/visualization/animation/animation-editor/quick-start/)

## Common Issues to Watch For

Test guidance will sometimes note specific issues to watch for. The common issues below should be watched for through all testing, even if unrelated to the current workflow being tested.
- Asset processor errors when saving animation settings.
- Warnings or Errors that appear in the Editor Console Log while setting up or running scenes.
- Errors appearing in the Animation Editor's Log Window view.
- Broken Animation behaviors.

## Workflows

### Area: Morphing

**Project Requirements**

Any project that has the following Gems enabled:

* O3DE\Gems\EMotionFX
* O3DE\Gems\ScriptedEntityTweener
* O3DE\Gems\PrimitiveAssets

Assets:
* Actor with morph targets and morph animation is present in the project.
* Alternatively - Actor included in AutomatedTesting project - [morphActor](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/tree/development/AutomatedTesting/Objects/MorphTargets)

**Platforms:**
* Windows
* Linux

**Docs:**
* [Using Morph Targets to Deform Characters](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/visualization/animation/animation-editor/using-morph-targets-to-deform-characters/)

**Product:** 
Actor with morph targets plays morph animation in the Animation Editor.

**Suggested Time Box:** 30 minutes per platform.

### Area: Level of Detail

**Project Requirements**

Any project that has the following Gems enabled:

* O3DE\Gems\EMotionFX
* O3DE\Gems\ScriptedEntityTweener
* O3DE\Gems\PrimitiveAssets

Assets:
* Actor with Level of Detail is present in the project.

**Platforms:**
* Windows
* Linux

**Docs:**
* [Scene Settings](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/assets/scene-settings/scene-settings/)
* [Using Actor LODs to Optimize Game Performance](https://www.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/visualization/animation/using-actor-lods-optimize-game-performance/)

**Product:** 
Actor with Level of Detail setup working in the Editor.

**Suggested Time Box:** 30 minutes per platform.

| Workflow                     | Requests           | Things to Watch For |
|------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
